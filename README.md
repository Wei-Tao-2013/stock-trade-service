# Application Description

### Suppose we could access yesterdayâ€™s stock prices as a list, where:

* The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 10:00am local time.
* The values are the price in dollars of the Latitude Financial stock at that time.
* So if the stock cost $5 at 11:00am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 5.
* You must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

### For example:

Given stock price as below 

[3, 20, 19.15, 18, 25.23, 13, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6]

The application will give the below detail trade transaction that demonstrates how did you make the maximum profit by buy & sell. 

* The max profit price was $22.23 per share.

* Trade Transaction: Bought the stock at 10:00 with price $3 and sold the stock at 10:04 with price $25.23 .
